# What Is "Tinkercad"?

### [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) is a simple, online 3D design and 3D printing app for everyone.
Tinkercad is used to make toys, prototypes, home decor, Minecraft models, jewelry and many more things.
### How it works:

#### 1. Place
Shapes are basic building blocks of Tinkercad. A shape can add or remove material. Import your own, or work with existing shapes.
#### 2. Adjust
Move, rotate and adjust shapes freely in space. Use tools like the ruler to input exact dimensions.
#### 3. Combine
Group together a set of shapes to create models as detailed as you want.
