# Elementary Inquiry 2016-2017

## Inquiry Question
How does a project-based STEM learning environment increase authentic student engagement in Elementary Math, Science and the new Design and Coding curriculum?

## Rationale
- Target student group is Grades 6 and 7; 
- subject areas are Math, Science, Applied Design and Technology; 
- learning focus is Inquiry/Question-Based approaches, including project-based learning, as per [New BC Curriculum](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/overview).

## Student Learning Focus
- developing Math, Science, and Coding knowledge, and skills in a hands-on, project-based environment;
- acquiring practical skills and knowledge that students’ can use to bring their ideas from conception to fruition;
- developing a sense of efficacy and personal agency about students’ ability to participate as agents of change to solve practical problems in a rapidly changing world;
- developing a lifelong interest in designing and making;
- using Creative and Critical Thinking, Collaboration, and Communication to solve problems, address issues, and make decisions.
