# Applied Design, Skills and Technologies

As of September 2016, BC K - 9 Teachers have been using the new BC [Applied Design, Skills and Technologies](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/applied-design-skills-and-technologies/introduction) Curriculum.

> B.C.’s Kindergarten to Grade 12 (K-12) education system is being modernized with new curriculum. In the fall of 2015, we began the three-year process of transitioning to the new curriculum.
> Beginning in September 2016, students in K-9 learn the new curriculum only. 
> A key goal \[of the new curruculum\] is to provide students with an education that is flexible and innovative. They’ll also gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to succeed in today’s world.
> Another goal is making sure that teachers can deliver the curriculum efficiently and effectively. The new system provides teachers with more time and flexibility to explore topics in depth with students.
