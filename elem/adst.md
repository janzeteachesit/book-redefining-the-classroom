# Applied Design, Skills and Technologies

## A New Curriculum

> B.C.’s Kindergarten to Grade 12 (K-12) education system is being modernized with new curriculum. In the fall of 2015, we began the three-year process of transitioning to the new curriculum.
> Beginning in September 2016, students in K-9 learn the new curriculum only. 
> A key goal \[of the new curruculum\] is to provide students with an education that is flexible and innovative. They’ll also gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to succeed in today’s world.
> Another goal is making sure that teachers can deliver the curriculum efficiently and effectively. The new system provides teachers with more time and flexibility to explore topics in depth with students.

As of September 2016, BC K - 9 Teachers have been using the new BC [Applied Design, Skills and Technologies](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/applied-design-skills-and-technologies/introduction) Curriculum.  

> The ability to design and make, acquire skills as needed, and apply technologies is important in the world today and a key aspect of educating citizens for the future.
> The new Applied Design, Skills, and Technologies (ADST) curriculum is an experiential, hands-on program of learning through design and creation that includes skills and concepts from traditional and First Peoples practice; from the existing disciplines of Business Education, Home Economics, Information Technology, and Technology Education; and from new and emerging fields. It envisions a K–12 continuum fostering the development of the skills and knowledge that will allow students to create practical and innovative responses to everyday needs and problems.
