# Letter sent home with Term 2 Reports

### Where are the percentages? / Why the new format?

As you may know, the Ministry of Education is in the midst of redesigning curriculum for all grades. What is less common knowledge is that assessment practices are also part of the redesign. I am part of an Inquiry team (that includes the Science Department Head, the Mini School Department Head and our Vice-Principal) looking at how this could work at Templeton. 

The intent of the VSB Inquiry Project into Communicating Student Learning is to work together at the school level and explore methods for documenting knowledge, skills and attitudes (and helping our students to document their learning).

These documents represent a movement towards a more descriptive way of sharing Student Learning with parents, and is a first draft.

The “Term 2 Reflections” document is your child’s first attempt to reflect on their own learning and to begin the process of setting goals about their learning, based on the Core Competencies (see below for links)..

The “Term 2 Evaluations” for Math, Science and Applied Design are taken directly from the relevant sections of the new curriculum (see below for links).

I hope this helps.  Please feel free to email me with questions, comments or suggestions.

Sincerely

Carl Janze
