# Communicating Student Learning
## District Inquiry Project 2016-2018

> The intent of the VSB District Inquiry Project into Communicating Student Learning is to work together at the school level and explore methods for documenting knowledge, skills and attitudes (and helping our students to document their learning) and then to come together at the District level to discuss the myriad of opportunities and possibilities around Communicating Student Learning.
